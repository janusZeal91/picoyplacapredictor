# Building and Testing

This app was developed using Ionic V3.9.2 and Node 10.19.0. Using a higher version of Node throws a compilation error due to incompatibility problems with some Ionic 3 libraries. 

# If you don't already have Ionic installed:
    > npm install --save ionic@3.9.2 

# An specific version of node can be installed on windows using NVM 
    > npm install --save nvm
    > nvm install 10.19.0
    > nvm use 10.19.0 

# Install all required dependencies 
    > npm install --save 

# Ionic 3 has an integrated development live-server which can be used to deploy the app for testing by using command
    > ionic serve 

# All unit tests has been implemented using Karma and Jasmine. Run the tests by using 
    > npm run test
